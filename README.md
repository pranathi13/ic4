## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to start learning about HTML and CSS.  

## Instructions

1. Background material to support this assignment is provided below in the Resources section.  

1. Create a GitHub Page for your repo and add the link to your GitHub Page above where you see `[insert your clickable hyperlink here]`. 

1. Clone this repo and work locally. Be sure to push the final version of your code (and any significant updates along the way) before submitting. 

1. Open the index.html file included in your repo. Please do the following: 
   - Title your webpage "ic-04". 
   - Add a heading that says "Intro to HTML and CSS".
   - Add a smaller heading with your name.
   - Add a div with the id "div1" and the class "container".
   - Add a paragraph inside of div1. Give the paragraph the id "p1" and class "italic". Fill in your paragraph with this text: "My favorite visualization is [insert favorite visualization]".  
   - Add a another div to your webpage. This div should **not** be a child of div1. Give this div the id "div2" and class "container".
   - Add an svg rect inside of div2. Make it any color you want except for black or white.

1. After completing the previous step, draw the DOM for your webpage. Add this drawing to the document you will submit for this assignment. 

1. Create an *external* stylesheet for your webpage. Name it style.css and add the code nescessary to reference it in your index.html file. Using this stylesheet please:
   - Set the font of your webpage to Arial. 
   - Center "Intro to HTML and CSS" and your name. 
   - Give any objects with the class "container" a black border. 
   - Give any objects with the class "italic" italicized font.
